## Description

Study Manager is a web application designed to help students organize and manage their academic tasks efficiently.

It allows users to create, edit, and track tasks, set deadlines, and categorize their work to improve productivity and avoid missing important assignments.

⭐ Key Features\
    - 🔐 User Authentication (JWT) — each user has a personal workspace\
    - 📝 Task Management (CRUD) — create, update, delete, and view tasks\
    - 📂 Categories — organize tasks by subjects or topics\
    - 🔍 Search & Filtering — quickly find tasks by name or status\
    - ⏱ Deadline Tracking — keep track of upcoming assignments\
    - 📊 Progress Tracking — monitor completed vs pending tasks\

You can add a Team Project feature where users can create a team with friends and work on shared academic projects together.

### What users can do
    - create a team
    - invite friends to join
    - create a group project inside the team
    - assign tasks to team members
    - track the progress of the whole group
    - see who completed which task

### Main idea

There will be:
    - personal tasks for one user
    - team projects for several users

So the app supports both individual study planning and group work.

You can add these models:

Team\
    - name\
    - description\
    - creator\
TeamMember\
    - user\
    - team\
    - role\
Project\
    - title\
    - description\
    - deadline\
    - team\
ProjectTask\
    - title\
    - status\
    - assigned_user\
    - project\
